There's probably some really great reason that xmlrpc has it's own datetime
parser? But it won't parse the time stamps I'm getting from a Zope database,
and DateTime will. So.

And while I'm sure it's infinitely sensible not to allow nils by default, I
need them. And I'm tired of looking at the warnings. So.
